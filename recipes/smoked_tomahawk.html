    <h3>A meal for guys who want to have the texas vibe</h3>
    
    <p>This massive piece of beef, cut right outta the ribs, is only real with it's handle on.</p>
    <p>It's gonna get eaten with bare hands right out of the smoker, with no side dishes, to fully focus on it.</p>
    <p>I can only recommend you a cold one, or if you are serious, get you some Barrique Wine to drink.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tomahawk steak(s)</li>
      <li>Coarse kosher salt (for dry brining)</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>Texas style rub</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Step by step</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><h4>Dry brining:</h4>Sprinkle the salt on top, and get the steaks into the fridge.</li>
      <li><h4>Season them:</h4>Just apply some olive oil onto the steaks and spread your seasoning.</li>
      <li><h4>Smoke the steak(s) to 43Â°C:</h4>This will set up the perfect conditions to reverse searing them afterwards.</li>
      <li><h4>Fire up your grill or charcoal chimney</h4></li>
      <li><h4>Reverse sear them:</h4>Sear them until you like the colour.</li>
      <li><h4>Take them out and let them rest for 10 minutes</h4></li>
      <li><h4>Serve</h4></li>
    </ol>
